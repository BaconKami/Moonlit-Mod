This is a Songs of War inspired mod. The main feature and attraction of this mod is the addition of Moonlits, the Magnorite equivalent of werewolves.
These beasts aren't all hostile, however. Actually, most are neutral. Will you hunt them? Will you try to befriend them? Become one?
That's completely up to you! There's BIG focus on relationships, reputation, impact, consequence, and balance in the playstyles.
Yes, you can change your path in the game, but it will probably be hard.
